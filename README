Overview
========
mstatus is a uber-minimalistic signal based statusbar for DWM. All components of
the statusbar are modules that must either be written by the user, or written by
someone else and copied by the user.

The statusbar is entirely signal based. This means that for any module to update
the signal corresponding to said module must be sent. To update the first module
for example, one could do this:

	$ kill -34 mstatus

If you would like to create your own modules, you can checkout the two included
examples in the `src/modules/` directory.


How to create a module
======================
This is all documented in the modules.h header file (src/modules.h).


How to configure the statusbar
==============================
This is all documented in the config.h header file (src/config.h).


How do I make my clock run if mstatus won't automatically refresh it?
=====================================================================
Read the documentation in the config.h headerfile. I personally do so by using
a cronjob.
